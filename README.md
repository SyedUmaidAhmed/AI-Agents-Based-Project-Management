This project is basically the automation of our company Asana platform through Access token and Developer API's

# LLM Based AI Agents

LLM agents are advanced AI systems designed for creating complex text that needs sequential reasoning. They can think ahead, remember past conversations, and use different tools to adjust their responses based on the situation and style needed.

## Introduction
AI agents are autonomous intelligent systems performing specific tasks without human intervention. Organizations use AI agents to achieve specific goals. 

### Prerequisites

You need to have an OpenAI key for the purpose of using LLMs. Install the requirements.txt file first and setup the environment file. Add ASANA access token and OpenAI_API_KEY and project/workspace ID. I have provided sample files of environment.

```
nano .env
OPEN_AI_KEY = "sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development-env running

Make the Virtual Environment with Version of Python=3.11. Run the "requirements.txt" file in the Virtual Environment

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
